## üõµ What it does

[Middy](https://middy.js.org/) is a very simple middleware engine that allows you to simplify your AWS Lambda code when using Node.js. As I always had to implement and reimplement this type of logic, I decide to wrap up and give back tcommunity middleware for that validates a reCAPTCHA token in the body of a `POST` request.

### What is Middy

From the [docs]((https://github.com/middyjs/middy#what-is-middy)):



If you have used web frameworks like Express, then you will be familiar with the concepts adopted in Middy and you will be able to get started very quickly.

A middleware engine allows you to focus on the strict business logic of your Lambda and then attach additional common elements like authentication, authorization, validation, serialization, etc. in a modular and reusable way by decorating the main business logic.

------

If you are using Middy and have some public facing API chances are you'll need more security. This simple middleware will validate the token from [reCAPTCHA v3](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3).

## üöÄ Install

Use your favorite package manager:

```bash
yarn add middy-recaptcha
```

```bash
npm install middy-recaptcha -S
```

## Usage

Besides `@middy/core`, you must also use `@middy/http-json-body-parser` since this middleware will read the request body and needed parsed as json.


To integrte with your frontend you just need to follow the guide from [reCAPTCHA to rogrammatically invoke the challenge](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3#programmatically_invoke_the_challenge). The you need to pass the token generate in the body of your post request like this example:

```tsx
const onSubmit = data => {
        setSubmited(true)
        window?.grecaptcha.ready(function() {
          window?.grecaptcha.execute('<Your public reCAPTCHA key>', {action: 'submit'}).then(function(token) {
            let payload = {
              token: token // In the current version, it must be sent in the body of the POST as token.
            }
            setPayload(JSON.stringify(payload, null, 2))
          });
        });
  };
```
In the folder `backend` you will find a CDK boilerplate to go up and running an HTTP API and in `demo` a simple NextJS example with the best react form lib[1]. These docs will be updated soon.

### Canonical example, most secure

```ts
import middy from "@middy/core";
import cors from "@middy/http-cors";
import httpSecurityHeaders from "@middy/http-security-headers";
import jsonBodyParser from "@middy/http-json-body-parser";
import ssm from "@middy/ssm";
import reCAPTCHA from "middy-recaptcha";


import type {
  APIGatewayProxyEvent,
  APIGatewayProxyResult,
  Context,
} from "aws-lambda";

interface IReCAPTCHA extends Context {
  reCAPTCHA?: {
    success: boolean;
    challenge_ts: string;
    hostname: string;
    score: number;
    action: string;
  };
}

async function baseHandler(
  _event: APIGatewayProxyEvent,
  context: Context
): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> {
  const ctx: IReCAPTCHA = context;

  const message = {
    data: {
      message: "Hello from the other Side!",
      success: ctx?.reCAPTCHA?.success,
      score: ctx?.reCAPTCHA.score,
      challenge_ts: ctx?.reCAPTCHA?.challenge_ts,
      hostname: ctx?.reCAPTCHA?.hostname,
      action: ctx?.reCAPTCHA?.action,
    },
  };

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(message, null, 2),
  };
}

let handler = middy(baseHandler);
handler
  .use(
    ssm({
      fetchData: {
        recaptchaSecret: "/dev/recaptcha/secret",
      },
      setToContext: true,
    })
  )
  .use(jsonBodyParser())
  .use(cors())
  .use(httpSecurityHeaders())
  .use(reCAPTCHA()); // Here goes our Middleware. 

export { handler };
```
### Fast example, but not so best in security practices

```ts
// Everything the same, but you don't use "@middy/ssm" to fecth the secret key to validate in the backend your webapp, so it will need to pass the value as string as 'secret'. 
let handler = middy(baseHandler);
handler
  .use(
  .use(jsonBodyParser())
  .use(cors())
  .use(httpSecurityHeaders())
  .use(reCAPTCHA({
    secret: "<here goes your secret key>"
  })); // Here goes our Middleware.

export { handler };
```

With `secret`you can load your secret key from an `.env` file or env parameters for your Lambda or hardcode the value. But, off course, none of us will ever do this kind of reckless nonsense.

## Options

| Prop   |      Type      |  Description |
|----------|:--------:|------------|
| **secret** | string | Secret key from the reCAPTCHA admin. Highly recommend to use System Setting Manager.|
| threshold | number | Default: `0.8`  reCAPTCHA v3 returns a score (1.0 is very likely a good interaction, 0.0 is very likely a bot). Based on the score, you can take variable action in the context of your site.  |
| useIp | boolean |    Default `false` Optional. The user's IP address. |

### TODO
- Improve docs. I want to do a write-up about the backend and frontend integration soon.
